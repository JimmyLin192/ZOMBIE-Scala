## Modified ZOMBIE (M-ZOMBIE) DSL in Scala
ZOMBIE is a programming language designed for Necromancers, particularly evil ones. ZOMBIE is an acronym, and stands for Zombie-Oriented Machine-Being Interface Engine.

## Usage


## M-ZOMBIE Language

Entities are the basic elements of a ZOMBIE program. Valid ZOMBIE programs must declare at least one entity.
Entities are declared with the following structure:

	entity-type(entity-name) { entity-statements }

Entity-type is one of the following: **ZOMBIE**, **GHOST**, **VAMPIRE**, **DEMON**, **DJINN**.

Entity-name is any well-formed identifier string.

Entity-statements is a list of any valid statements, which may include entity declarations.
